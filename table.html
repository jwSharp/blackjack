                    Player wishes to be dealt another card to add to their hand.
                    The goal is to get as close to a sum of 21 without going over.
                </dd>

                <dt>Stand</dt>
                <dd>
                    Player wishes to keep current hand and finish their turn.
                    Traditionally, a hand totalling 17 or higher should be kept.
                </dd>

                <dt>Split</dt>
                <dd>
                    Player was dealt two of the same card.
                    Player wishes to split their hand into two hands.
                    This will double their bet and treat each hand separately.
                    Player may only hit one on each.
