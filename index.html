                    Blackjack is sometimes referred to a game of skill. Despite clear theoretical odds,
                    some believe that those who surpass working knowledge get an edge.

                Blackjack is a game that requires a standard deck of 52 cards.
                Two players are suggested to play, though the game may be played with just one.
                The goal of the game is to get cards that add up as close to 21 as you can without going over.
                Each player individually plays the dealer.
                The person closer to 21 without exceeding wins the round.
                Betting may or may not be included depending on the crowd.
